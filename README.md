# Memory Game Project (Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree)

This game was created as the second project in Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree course. It was modified from starter code (which can be found at https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) that was provided as part of the course. All CSS, images, and HTML elements were included in the starter code however the shuffle algorithm (taken from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976) used to shuffle the deck of cards was the only JavaScript code included. All other JavaScript code was written by Luke Scales, 2019.
